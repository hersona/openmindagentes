# Project Specifications Context

This project follows detailed specifications that must always be considered when working on any code changes or features.

## Documentation Structure

All project specifications are located in the `docs/` folder:

- **docs/functional-spec.md**: Functional specification of the entire platform
  - Project vision and architecture
  - Module descriptions and user flows
  - Frontend-backend communication patterns
  - API endpoints and data flow

- **docs/technical-spec.md**: Technical specification
  - Tech stack (React + Vite, Node.js + Express, Tailwind CSS)
  - Architecture details (unified server system)
  - Component structure
  - Payload structures by agent type
  - Design system guidelines

- **docs/features/**: Module-specific specifications
  - **docs/features/courage-lab-spec.md**: The Courage Lab module specification
    - Profile selection system
    - Integration with n8n
    - Component architecture
    - Visual design guidelines

## Key Principles

1. **Always reference the specs** before making changes to ensure consistency
2. **Follow the architecture**: Unified server system with centralized configuration
3. **Respect the design system**: Minimalist Apple-style design (black/white palette)
4. **Check module specs**: When working on a specific module, review its spec in `docs/features/`
5. **Maintain consistency**: Follow patterns established in the specs

## Configuration Files

- **agents.config.json**: Central configuration for all modules/agents
- All module configs are defined here, including profiles, webhook URLs, etc.

## Important Patterns

- Backend: Single Express server in `backend/server.js`
- Frontend: Single React app with React Router in `frontend/src/`
- API: `GET /api/agents` and `POST /api/agent/:id/execute`
- Configuration: Centralized in `agents.config.json` at root
- Design: Tailwind CSS with black/white minimalist theme
